  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">About Food Squad: A Student Project</h1>

  <p class="text-lg text-white mb-6">Welcome to Food Squad, an innovative food ordering platform developed as a student project. I, George, am the sole creator and developer behind Food Squad, driven by a passion for technology and a love for good food. Food Squad isn't just an app; it's a culmination of my dedication to learning and exploring new avenues in the digital world.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Our Mission</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-white mb-6">Food Squad was born out of a desire to explore the intersection of technology and gastronomy, without the aim of generating profit. My mission with Food Squad is simple: to create a convenient and enjoyable food ordering experience for users, while also gaining valuable skills and knowledge as a student.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Our Vision</h2>
  <p class="text-lg text-white mb-6">While many food apps focus on profit and scalability, Food Squad's vision is unique. I envision Food Squad as a platform that prioritizes learning and experimentation, providing users with a glimpse into the capabilities of student-driven projects. Through Food Squad, I aim to showcase the creativity and innovation that students can bring to the table.</p>
